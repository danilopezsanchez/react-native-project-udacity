# Getting Started with this project

This project was developed as the third project for Senior Front End Engineer - OLX Scholarship.

It's a a customer relationship manager (CRM) for mobile.

Imagine that the company you are working for has sales representatives who are responsible for reaching out to customers and potential customers in their region. The sales representatives are constantly updating customer information, but it's challenging for them to collect all the information they take in during the day, then sit at their computers in the evening to input their updates into the system. The hours between data gathering and input have led to low-quality data, or no data at all, being put into the system, making it easy for company data to go out of date.

## Available Scripts

Firt of all you must do:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npx expo start`

or

### `npx expo start --tunnel` (This option avoid problems with mobile devices)

## Considerations

Notifications are only available in mobile devices, not web browsers. The notification will appear 10 seconds after creating or editing a customer if the input field of reminder is active
